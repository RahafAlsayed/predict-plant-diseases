            <h3>Graduation Project – University of Jeddah</h3>
            <p>
                This project was developed by <strong>Data Science students from the University of Jeddah</strong>,
                under the supervision of <strong>Dr. Heba Fasihuddin</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system aims to support plant health monitoring by providing an AI tool that
                analyzes leaf images and predicts the presence of plant diseases with high accuracy.

            <h3>Model Development & Selection</h3>
            <p>
                Several deep learning models were trained and tested, including
                <strong>GoogLeNet</strong>, <strong>YOLO models</strong>, and <strong>MobileNetV3</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                After experimenting with multiple architectures, feature tuning,
                and performance comparisons, two models were selected:
                <strong>MobileNetV3-Large</strong> and <strong>YOLOv11</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                These models achieved the highest scores across accuracy, precision,
                recall, and F1-score, making them the most reliable choices for deployment.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 3 -->
        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>How the Web System Works</h3>
            <p>
                The user uploads an image of a plant leaf through the website interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                The image is processed and passed to both deployed models:
                <strong>MobileNetV3-Large</strong> and <strong>YOLOv11</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each model predicts the disease type (or healthy condition) based on training data.
                The system then displays the final classification result to the user,
                showing the detected disease name and health status.
